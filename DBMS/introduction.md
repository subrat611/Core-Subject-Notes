## What is Data?

- Data is a collection of raw, unorganized facts and details like text, observations, figures, symbols,
  and descriptions of things etc.
- In other words, data does not carry any specific purpose and has no significance by itself.
  Moreover, data is measured in terms of bits and bytes – which are basic units of information in the
  context of computer storage and processing.
- Data can be recorded and doesn’t have any meaning unless processed.
- Data is represented with the help of characters such as alphabets (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9) or special characters (+,-,/,\*,<,>,= etc.)

  > **Example:**
  >
  > A number 28.
  >
  > What does it mean by 28 (age, height, distance, day, likes)
