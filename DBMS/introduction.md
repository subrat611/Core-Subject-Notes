## What is Data?

- Data is a collection of raw, unorganized facts and details like text, observations, figures, symbols,
  and descriptions of things etc.
- In other words, data does not carry any specific purpose and has no significance by itself.
  Moreover, data is measured in terms of bits and bytes – which are basic units of information in the
  context of computer storage and processing.
- Data can be recorded and doesn’t have any meaning unless processed.
- Data is represented with the help of characters such as alphabets (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9) or special characters (+,-,/,\*,<,>,= etc.)

  > **Example:**
  >
  > A number 28.
  >
  > What does it mean by 28 (age, height, distance, day, likes, marks)

### Types of data

| Quantitative                     | Qualitative                           |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Numerical form                   | Descriptive, but not numerical.       |
| Weight, volume, cost of an item. | Name, gender, hair color of a person. |

## What is Information?

- Information provides context of the data and enables decision making.
- It is the processed data.
- E.g.,you have data of all the people living in your locality, its Data, when you analyze and interpret
  the data and come to some conclusion that:

  i. There are 100 senior citizens.

  ii. The sex ratio is 1.1.

  iii. Newborn babies are 100.

  These are information.

- For the decision to be meaningful, the processed data must qualify for the following characteristics

  - Timely − Information should be available when required.

  - Accuracy − Information should be accurate.

  - Completeness − Information should be complete.

## Data vs Information

| Data                                                                                  | Information                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Data are the variables that help to develop ideas/conclusions.                     | 1. Information is meaningful data.                                                       |
| 2. Data are text and numerical values.                                                | 2. Information is refined form of actual data.                                           |
| 3. Data doesn’t rely on Information.                                                  | 3. While Information relies on Data.                                                     |
| 4. Bits and Bytes are the measuring unit of data.                                     | 4. Information is measured in meaningful units like time, quantity, etc.                 |
| 5. Data can be easily structured as the following: 1.Tabular data 2.Graph 3.Data tree | 5. Information can also be structured as the following: 1. Language 2. Ideas 3. Thoughts |
| 6. Data does not directly helps in decision making.                                   | 6. Information directly helps in decision making.                                        |
| 7. Example of data is student test score.                                             | 7. Example of information is average score of class that is derived from given data.     |

## What is Database?

- A database is a collection of data that is organized, which is also called structured data. It can be accessed or stored in a computer system.
- The data in common databases is modelled in tables, making querying and processing efficient.
- Structured query language (SQL) is commonly used for data querying and writing.

### Relational Database:

- A relational database is made up of a set of tables with data that fits into a predefined category.

### Distributed Database:

- A distributed database is a database in which portions of the database are stored in multiple physical locations, and in which processing is dispersed or replicated among different points in a network.

### Cloud Database:

- A cloud database is a database that typically runs on a cloud computing platform. Database service provides access to the database. Database services make the underlying software stack transparent to the user.

## What is DBMS?

- A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to access those data.
- The collection of data, usually referred to as the database, contains information relevant to an enterprise.
- The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is both convenient and efficient.
- A DBMS is the database itself, along with all the software and functionality. It is used to perform different operations, like addition, access, updating, and deletion of the data.

## DBMS vs File Systems

File-processing systems has major disadvantages.

    - Data Redundancy and inconsistency
    - Difficulty in accessing data
    - Data isolation
    - Integrity problems
    - Atomicity problems
    - Concurrent-access anomalies
    - Security problems
